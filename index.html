<h2>Childhood Years</h2>
<div class="Childhood">
<p>
I grew up in the quiet and beautiful province of Masbate, where life moved slowly and peacefully.<sup>1</sup>
My childhood was filled with long days under the sun and the fresh smell of grass from the open fields.<sup>2</sup>
I spent countless afternoons playing traditional Filipino games with school kids who became like siblings to me.<sup>3</sup>
We played bente uno until our legs grew tired and our laughter echoed across the street.<sup>4</sup>
Agawang base became our favorite pastime, especially during warm summer evenings.<sup>5</sup>
I also collected pogs, which felt like small treasures that made my young heart excited.<sup>6</sup>
Each new pog made me feel like I discovered gold.<sup>7</sup>
I loved climbing trees, especially mango trees that stood tall near our house.<sup>8</sup>
Reaching the highest branch always felt like winning a secret challenge against nature.<sup>9</sup>
Sometimes we would sit on the branches and tell stories while feeling the wind brush against our faces.<sup>10</sup>
Life in Masbate felt simple yet magical in its own way.<sup>11</sup>
I never had many toys, but the outdoors became my playground.<sup>12</sup>
I learned creativity from making games out of anything I could find.<sup>13</sup>
My family taught me humility and kindness at a very early age.<sup>14</sup>
They also taught me to appreciate small things in life.<sup>15</sup>
Growing up surrounded by nature made me feel connected to the world.<sup>16</sup>
Every day felt like a new adventure waiting for me outside our doorstep.<sup>17</sup>
My childhood shaped who I am today in ways I will always be grateful for.<sup>18</sup>
Those moments of innocence and fun remain some of my greatest memories.<sup>19</sup>
Masbate will forever hold the roots of my earliest and happiest days.<sup>20</sup>
